# Final Project â€“ Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python (IBM)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains my final project for the **Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python** course by IBM.  
The project demonstrates the use of SQL to query, analyze, and manage data, as well as the integration of SQL with Python for data science workflows.

The primary objective is to showcase proficiency in:
- Designing and querying relational databases.
- Applying SQL for data extraction, filtering, aggregation, and joins.
- Using Python to interact with databases and process query results.
